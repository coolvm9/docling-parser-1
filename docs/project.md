# Project Phased Build Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for building the FastAPI project with IBM Docling integration, notebook support, and local tooling.

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- Create project directory structure
- Initialize FastAPI application
- Set up basic service structure
- Add initial dependencies (FastAPI, IBM Docling, etc.)

## Phase 2: IBM Docling Integration
- Implement core service(s) using IBM Docling
- Add endpoints for document parsing
- Test integration with sample data

## Phase 3: Notebook Support
- Set up Jupyter notebook environment
- Create example notebooks demonstrating service usage
- Document notebook workflows

## Phase 4: Local Tools & Utilities
- Add scripts/utilities for local testing
- Provide sample data and test cases in `data/`

## Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization
- Expand documentation
- Add usage examples and API references
- Prepare for deployment or further extension

## Required Frameworks and Libraries

- FastAPI – for building the REST API
- Uvicorn or uv – ASGI server to run FastAPI
- IBM Docling – for document parsing and information extraction
- PyPDF2 or pdfplumber – for PDF file handling (if pre-processing is needed before Docling)
- Pydantic – for request/response data validation (comes with FastAPI)
- python-multipart – for handling file uploads in FastAPI
- Jupyter – for notebook support (optional, for development and demos)

Example requirements (requirements.txt):

```
fastapi
uv
ibm-docling
pypdf2
python-multipart
jupyter
```
